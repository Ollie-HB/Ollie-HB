## About me

I am a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a distinguished, 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, and I am incredibly excited to be searching for my first role as a Software Developer. After working in the charity and education sector for a number of years, I took the daunting decision to change careers and pursue a new challenge in the form of Software Development. Since taking the plunge into the world of programming, I haven't looked back, and I am thrilled to be continuously learning and developing every day. 

In my previous career, I worked as a Trust Fundraiser for [Ambitious about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/), a charity providing support for autistic children and young people and promoting nerudiversity across the UK. Whilst I remain passionate about helping others, ultimately, I wanted to find a profession that made better use of my skills. My decision to switch careers was motivated by the need to further challenge myself, utilise my problem solving skillss, and the desire to engage my creative side in a dynamic, collaborative team environment. I am inquistive by nature, and have always been intrigued by technology and how things work, which is what first led me towards coding - shortly after writing my first few lines of code, I realised that Software Development was the career path and creative outlet I had been searching for.

I am moitvated by thinking through and solving complex problems, owing to my academic background in Philosophy. It quickly became apparent to me that there are a number of transferable skills between philosophical thinking and programming. Fundamentally, both require the use of analytical skills and logic to solve problems, though with programming, I found there is far greater scope to apply these skills in a creative and practical manner. I truly love to learn, and my hope is that I can build on the skills and knowledge I acquired at Makers at a company where I can contribute and grow as part of a team of passionate, driven developers. üßë‚Äçüíª
