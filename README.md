## About me

I am a recent graduate of the distinguished Software Engineering bootcamp, [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), and I am excited to be searching for my first role as a Software Developer. After working in the charity and education sector for a number of years, in the Summer of 2022, I made the decision to change career paths, and pursue a new challenge in the form of Software Development. Since taking the plunge into the world of programming, I haven't looked back, and I am thrilled to be continuously learning and developing on this exciting journey. 

In my previous career, I worked as a Trust Fundraiser for [Ambiitous about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/), a charity for autistic children and young people, providing support and promoting neurodiversity across the UK. Whilst I remain passionate about helping others, ultimately, I wanted to find a profession that made better use of my unique skillset. My decision to switch careers was motivated by the need to further challenge myself, utilise my problem solving abilities, and the desire to engage my creative side in a dynamic team environment, in ways I was unable to in previous roles. I am inquistive by nature, and have always been intrigued by technology and how things work, which is what first led me towards learning to code - this proved to be a revelatory decision, as I immediately knew that Software Development was the career I had been looking for.

I take genuine satisfaction from thinking about and solving complex problems, owing to my academic background in Philosophy. Once I began coding, it quickly became apparent to me that there are a number of transferable skills between philosophy and programming. Fundamentally, both require the use of analytical skills and logical thinkng to solve problems, though with programming, I found there is far greater scope to apply these skills in a creative and practical manner. I truly love to learn, and consider myself a compassionate and driven individual, and my hope is that I can build on the skills and knowledge I acquired at Makers at a company where I can contribute and grow as a new addition to a team of passionate Software Developers. üßë‚Äçüíª
