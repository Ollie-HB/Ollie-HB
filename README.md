## About me

Hi, I'm Ollie - welcome to my GitHub profile! üëã I am a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a highly-selective, 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, and I'm incredibly excited to be searching for my first role as a Software Developer. After working in the charity and education sectors for a number of years, in the Summer of 2022, I took the decision to change careers and pursue a new challenge in the form of Software Development. Since taking the plunge into the world of programming, I haven't looked back, and I am thrilled to be continuously learning and developing each day. ‚≠ê

In my previous role, I worked as a Trust Fundraiser for [Ambitious about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/), a charity providing support for autistic children and young people and promoting neurodiversity across the UK. Whilst I remain passionate about helping others, ultimately, I wanted to find a profession that was more aligned with my skillset and goals. I am inquistive by nature, and have always been intrigued by technology and how things work, which is what first led me towards coding - shortly after completing my first few coding challenges, I realised that Software Development was the career path (and creative outlet) I had been searching for.

I am motivated by thinking through and solving complex problems, owing to my academic background in Philosophy. It quickly became apparent to me that there are a number of transferable skills between philosophical thinking and programming. Fundamentally, both require the use of analytical skills and logic to solve problems, though with programming, I found there is far greater scope to apply these skills in a creative and practical manner. I truly love to learn, and my hope is that I can build on the skills and knowledge I acquired at Makers (and independently), at a company where I can ccontinue to grow in a collaborative team of passionate, driven developers, building creative solutions to important problems. üßë‚Äçüíªüî®

Organisation Skills ¬∑ Git/GitHub ¬∑ TDD ¬∑ Data analysis ¬∑ Emotional Intelligence & Empathy ¬∑ Creative Strategy ¬∑ Attention to detail ¬∑ Strong Communication Skills ¬∑ Management and Leadership

Fast & Independent Learner
The 4 month, intensive nature of studying at Makers ensures that all students graduate as an independent learner with the confidence and skills to embrace new technologies. The self-driven nature of the Makers course encourages all students to direct their own learning. This has given me the confidence to not only take on any technical challenge but to embrace learning new technologies. This skill has enabled me to rapidly pick up complex frameworks such as React Native and node.js, and to learn Javascript in one week. I look forward to continuing to pick up varying languages and frameworks to solve new problems within the world of programming.

Problem Solving
Makers Academy provides a focus on building internal processes within students so that no matter what the size of the problem, an analytical and solution driven process will always be followed. This has enabled me to break down larger tasks such as building an entire mobile app in a new framework or learning how to use an API for the first time into simpler, more manageable tasks.

The focus on research that my degree in Sociology provided has given me a creative approach to problem solving which I believe I have transferred over to programming. Whether this was coming up with innovative ways to access and manage data or research participants, I believe my strength during this degree was an innovative and proactive approach to large problems.

Teamwork
In my previous role as a Recruitment Consultant, the structure of the team and the ways in which we work ensured that all roles that we were working on were shared equally, as well as all candidate and client responsibilities. This meant that an amicable and friendly approach to working was essential, and also a flexible approach and mindset. My degree in Sociology furthered my interest in the inner workings of a team and has helped me to better function as part of one.

Furthermore, the emphasis on pair programming and team projects using Agile methodology have ensured that I am fully capable of quickly fitting in to any Software Development team.

Working to Deadlines
The client requests that I worked on in my previous role in Recruitment were usually worked to a 48 hour deadline, meaning that I became used to working in a highly pressurised, fast-paced environment. It was both our individual and collective responsibility to ensure that all deadlines were met no matter what.










## Experience

**Ambitious about Autism** (Nov 2019 - June 2022)
*Trust Fundraiser*

- Responsible for managing a large portfolio of Trust and Foundation donor relationships, remaining on top of numerous competing deadlines. The value of my portfolio was raised each year as I exceeded my targets, eventually overseeing a donor pool worth approximately ¬£100,000 per year.
-I wrote bespoke fundraising bids (ranging from ¬£1000-¬£25,000) and reports for high-value clients. This involved liaising with project delivery teams, our finance department and external Grants Managers to ensure our fundraising product met donor's needs, showcased the fantastic work of the charity and enabled accurate and consistent reporting upon a grant's conclusion.
- Undertook extensive prospect reserach to identify income growth potential, which involved managing two Prospect Research volunteers, planning their workload to achieve maximum benefit for the charity.
- I was Project Manager for all small-to-medium sized projects across the three schools in our education network - this meant working closely with school staff, contractors and Heads of Department across fundraising and finance to ensure our projects and services ran smoothly, deadlines were met and budgets were adhered to.
- I recieved an award for Outstanding Contribution to the charity in my first year, thanks to my successful application for two Sunshine Coach minibuses for TreeHouse School (worth ¬£80,000+), and during my two years at the charity, I a proud to say that I raised over ¬£225,000.

- Planning, executing  and volunteering at events to boost the profile of the charity in the UK.

## Education

Makers Academy (Aug 2022 - Dec 2022) - 16 week Software Development Bootcamp
- **Learning how to learn coding languages:** Makers doesn't simply teach one coding language; instead, the focus is on developing the necessary skills for picking up and adapting to new coding languages. After working in Ruby for 10 weeks, I was able to apply the concepts we'd developed to learning JavaScript, which took only two weeks, giving me confidence when working with new languages.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Gained a thorough understanding of how to write strong, behaviour-focused tests and the benefits of test-driven code using the Red-Green-Refactor model.
- **Pair programming:** Established fantastic working relationships with peers in daily pairing sessions, working as both 'driver' and navigator' to achieve shared goals.
- **Debugging:** Learnt the importance of getting visibility when faced with an error and how to follow stack trace messages to find and fix a problem at the source.
- **Object Oriented-Design:**

Object-oriented design is a way of structuring code using objects and classes. The software is created by creating a system of classes that interact to perform the job of the software.

Classes are blueprints for objects, and objects encapsulate ('wrap') values ('state' or 'memory'), providing methods that control access to those values and do useful work.

Structuring programs is very important because programs can get very large and hard to understand. If you don't break them down into small parts each with a particular job they become expensive and time-consuming to maintain.

There are a number of approaches to structuring programs. OOD is the most popular.

I use an agile product development process
