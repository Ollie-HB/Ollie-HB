## About me :mushroom:

I'm Ollie, a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a highly-selective, 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, and I'm incredibly excited to be searching for my first role as a Software Developer. After working in the charity and education sectors for a number of years, I took the decision pursue a new challenge in the form of a career in Software Development. Since taking the plunge into the world of programming, I haven't looked back, and I am thrilled to be continuously learning and developing each day. ‚≠ê

In my previous role, I worked as a Trust Fundraiser for [Ambitious about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/), a charity providing support for autistic children and young people and promoting neurodiversity across the UK. Whilst I remain passionate about helping others, ultimately, I wanted to find a profession that better aligned with my skillset and personal goals. I am inquistive by nature, and have always been intrigued by technology and how things work, which first led me towards coding - shortly after completing my first few coding exercises, I realised that Software Development was the career path (and creative outlet) I had been searching for. üîç

I am motivated by thinking through and solving complex problems, owing to my academic background in Philosophy. It quickly became apparent that there are a number of transferable skills between philosophical thinking and programming. Fundamentally, both require the use of analytical skills and logic to solve problems, though with programming, there is far greater scope to apply these skills practically. I truly love to learn, and I plan to build on the skills and knowledge I acquired at Makers (and independently), at a company where I can continue to grow in a collaborative team of passionate, driven developers, building creative solutions to important problems. üßë‚Äçüíªüî®

## Skills üîß

- Problem solving
Makers Academy has processes within students so that no matter what the size of the problem, an analytical and solution driven process will always be followed. This has enabled me to break down larger tasks such as building an entire mobile app in a new framework or learning how to use an API for the first time into simpler, more manageable tasks.

The focus on research that my degree in Philosophy provided has given me a creative approach to problem solving which I believe I have transferred over to programming. Whether this was coming up with innovative ways to access and manage data or research participants, I believe my strength during this degree was an innovative and proactive approach to large problems.










Communication skills

In previous roles, I have utilised my communication skills across a range of different audiences. At Ambitious about Autism, I led meetings and delivered presentations to influential donors, with a view to securing a donation. These conversations required confidence, tact, and most importantly, listening skills, to understand what the donor wants and expects from a charity partenrship. These meetings resulted in a number of five-figure donations, as well as the renewal of a parternship worth ¬£20,000 per year. Equally, when working in graduate recruitment, I delivered slideshow presentations to audiences, 'selling' our internship programme to CEO's of small-to-medium sized businesses, which created dozens of new opportunities for our candidates. When working at schools with autistic children, I had to be incredibly clear and considered in my communication, not only with the children, but also when navigating difficult discussions with parents, which further enhanced my ability to listen and communicate empathetically.

As a developer, I drew upon my empathetic communication skills when pairing and working on team projects. When taking on a leadership role

maiing sur eevry voice is head when I;m a leader, and being able to speak up if I had an idea.. The whole cding experienc ewas enhance d by communciating effectively with peers and creating an environment of openness and tolerance, particuallry in a filed wherw we are all a bit unsure ..










Client and Relationship Management

Discenr and unpick their needs, all bult on steady communication and making myself invaluable to their experience with the compnay. Foestring relationhsips, ad hoc communication - being able to listen?

Fast Learner
The 4 month, intensive nature of studying at Makers ensures that all students graduate as an independent learner with the confidence and skills to embrace new technologies. The self-driven nature of the Makers course encourages all students to direct their own learning. This has given me the confidence to not only take on any technical challenge but to embrace learning new technologies. This skill has enabled me to rapidly pick up complex frameworks such as React Native and node.js, and to learn Javascript in one week. I look forward to continuing to pick up varying languages and frameworks to solve new problems within the world of programming.

Passion

Teamwork
In my previous role as a Recruitment Consultant, the structure of the team and the ways in which we work ensured that all roles that we were working on were shared equally, as well as all candidate and client responsibilities. This meant that an amicable and friendly approach to working was essential, and also a flexible approach and mindset. My degree in Sociology furthered my interest in the inner workings of a team and has helped me to better function as part of one.

Furthermore, the emphasis on pair programming and team projects using Agile methodology have ensured that I am fully capable of quickly fitting in to any Software Development team.

Working to Deadlines
The client requests that I worked on in my previous role in Recruitment were usually worked to a 48 hour deadline, meaning that I became used to working in a highly pressurised, fast-paced environment. It was both our individual and collective responsibility to ensure that all deadlines were met no matter what.

## Education üéì

**Makers Academy** (Aug 2022 - Dec 2022) - 16-week Software Development Bootcamp
- **Learning how to learn coding languages:** Makers doesn't simply teach one coding language; instead, the focus is on developing the necessary skills for picking up and adapting to new coding languages. After working in Ruby for 10 weeks, I was able to apply the concepts we'd developed to learning JavaScript, which took only two weeks, giving me confidence when working with new languages.
- **Test-Driven Development:** Gained a thorough understanding of how to write strong, behaviour-focused tests and the benefits of test-driven code using the Red-Green-Refactor model.
- **Pair programming:** Established fantastic working relationships with peers in daily pairing sessions, working as both 'driver' and navigator' to achieve shared goals.
- **Debugging:** Learned the importance of getting visibility when faced with an error and how to follow stack trace messages to find and fix a problem at the source.
- **Object Oriented-Design:** Can develop and structure applications using objects and classes, having learned how to split a program into smaller, manageable chunks of DRY code.
- **Databases:** Worked with PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord (ORM), MongoDB, Mongoose (ODM) and TablePlus to build databases and programs that store data and perform CRUD operations.
- **API's:** Used GET and POST requests to API's for a number of projects throughout the course, using Postman and testing to deepen my understanding of data transferral.
- **Agile workflow:** Followed Agile development processes to build projects as part of a team, complimented by various technologies; detailed planning (Excalidraw), tickets (Trello), sprints, retros (Miro), daily standups and iterative development.
