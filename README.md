## About me

I'm Ollie, a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a highly-selective, 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, and I'm incredibly excited to be searching for my first role as a Software Developer. After working in the charity and education sectors for a number of years, I took the decision pursue a new challenge and career in the form of Software Development. Since taking the plunge into the world of programming, I haven't looked back, and I am thrilled to be continuously learning and developing each day. ‚≠ê

In my previous role, I worked as a Trust Fundraiser for [Ambitious about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/), a charity providing support for autistic children and young people and promoting neurodiversity across the UK. Whilst I remain passionate about helping others, ultimately, I wanted to find a profession that better aligned with my skillset and personal goals. I am inquistive by nature, and have always been intrigued by technology and how things work, which first led me towards coding - shortly after completing my first few coding exercises, I realised that Software Development was the career path (and creative outlet) I had been searching for. üîç

I truly love to learn, and I plan to build on the skills and knowledge I acquired at Makers (and independently), at a company where I can continue to grow in a collaborative team of passionate, driven developers, building creative solutions to important problems. üßë‚Äçüíªüî®

## Skills

#### Communication skills

In previous roles, I have utilised my communication skills across a range of audiences. At Ambitious about Autism, I led meetings and delivered presentations to influential donors, with a view to securing donations. These conversations required confidence, tact, and most importantly, listening skills, to understand what a donor wants and expects from a charity partnership. These meetings resulted in a number of five-figure donations, most notably, the renewal of multi-year funding worth ¬£20,000 annually. Equally, when working in graduate recruitment, I delivered presentations selling our internship programme to audiences comprised of CEO's and business owners, which created new business and potential opportunities for our candidates. Working with autistic children required incredibly clear and considered communication, not only with the children, but also when navigating difficult discussions with parents, which further enhanced my ability to listen and communicate empathetically.

At Makers, daily pairing sessions meant that I worked with people who were ahead of me and behind me in their coding journeys, which called for frank and honest communication, both to ask questions and when taking on a more instructive role. I enjoyed taking on a leadership position in team projects, running stand-ups and retros, overseeing ticket allocation and fostering an open environment where all team members felt confident to share their ideas and opinions. Furthermore, the emphasis on working using Agile methodologies has ensured that I am fully capable of quickly fitting in to any Software Development team.

#### Problem solving

I am motivated by thinking through and solving complex problems, owing to my academic background in Philosophy. It quickly became apparent that there are a number of transferable skills between philosophical thinking and programming. Fundamentally, both require the use of analytical skills and logic to solve problems, though with programming, there is far greater scope to apply these skills practically. 

In my working life, I developed a keen eye for spotting problems and coming up with solutions that save time, streamline systems and improve the function of my own role. In my last role, I was keen to improve upon our prospect research system, as new leads were not being followed up in a consitent manner. I introduced a new system for capturing new prospects in a shared spreadsheet, with reminders being set up in our CRM for each team member to contact their allocated prospects, and feedback the outcome of each follow-up in a streamlined, half-hour meeting. This resulted in more responses from newly established trusts, more data captured in the system, and less time wasted through the team.

As a developer, I have further improved upon my problem solving by implementing Makers' processes for tackling coding problems, using TDD methodology and step-by-step learning techniques to ensure no matter the size of a problem, following an analytical and solution driven process will result in success. This enabled me to break down larger tasks such as building a dyanmic web-game in React, or learning how to communciate with API's into simpler, more manageable tasks.

#### Client and Relationship Management

I have a strong track record for working Discenr and unpick their needs, all bult on steady communication and making myself invaluable to their experience with the compnay. Foestring relationhsips, ad hoc communication - being able to listen?

This has been demonstrated in my Bank tech test feedback, where I was able to draw out what the 'client' wanted, and deliver a product that matched their needs - my reveiwer commented "I am absolutely delighted to review this submission. You have excellent code, tests, documentation, evaluation." I also demonstrated the ability to discern and deliver on client needs in my Reviews, where I had the feedback "

You were asking relevant questions which meant that you were able to clarify the main requirements of the program relatively quickly and you were able to flesh out a really good input-output table with your own examples for test cases. This was great as you were able to have a good place to keep track of the requirements that needed to be met and could just simply copy and paste the inputs and outputs into your tests.


You began your information-gathering by first noting down the client brief and the acceptance criteria of the programme. This top-down approach results in a better understanding of the core system that the client expects.

Your representation of the requirements of the system and questioning was sufficiently concise. You represented the requirements as acceptance criteria using an input-output table. This is an unambiguous representation of the system and allows you to explore the finer details of the programme's expected behaviour as well as potential edge cases.



Time management and working to deadlines
 
 -Agile work processes...
 
 Working to Deadlines
The client requests that I worked on in my previous role in Recruitment were usually worked to a 48 hour deadline, meaning that I became used to working in a highly pressurised, fast-paced environment. It was both our individual and collective responsibility to ensure that all deadlines were met no matter what.

TDD.
 
 ensured that we met the given Minimal Viable Product (MVP) 


Organisation Skills ¬∑ Git/GitHub ¬∑ TDD ¬∑ Data analysis ¬∑ Emotional Intelligence & Empathy ¬∑ Creative Strategy ¬∑ Attention to detail ¬∑ Strong Communication Skills ¬∑ Management and Leadership

Fast Learner
The 4 month, intensive nature of studying at Makers ensures that all students graduate as an independent learner with the confidence and skills to embrace new technologies. The self-driven nature of the Makers course encourages all students to direct their own learning. This has given me the confidence to not only take on any technical challenge but to embrace learning new technologies. This skill has enabled me to rapidly pick up complex frameworks such as React and node.js, and to learn Javascript in one week. I look forward to continuing to pick up varying languages and frameworks to solve new problems within the world of programming.

Passion

Teamwork
In my previous role as a Recruitment Consultant, the structure of the team and the ways in which we work ensured that all roles that we were working on were shared equally, as well as all candidate and client responsibilities. This meant that an amicable and friendly approach to working was essential, and also a flexible approach and mindset. My degree in Sociology furthered my interest in the inner workings of a team and has helped me to better function as part of one.

Furthermore, the emphasis on pair programming and team projects using Agile methodology have ensured that I am fully capable of quickly fitting in to any Software Development team.
