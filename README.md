## About me

I'm Ollie, a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), a highly-selective, 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, and I'm incredibly excited to be searching for my first role as a Junior Developer. After working in the charity and education sectors for a number of years, I took the decision pursue a new challenge and career in the form of Software Development. Since taking the plunge into the world of programming, I haven't looked back, and I'm thrilled to be continuously learning and developing each day. ⭐

In my previous role, I worked as a Trust Fundraiser for [Ambitious about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/), a charity providing support for autistic children and young people and promoting neurodiversity across the UK. Whilst I remain passionate about helping others, ultimately, I wanted to find a profession that better aligned with my skill set and personal goals. I am inquistive by nature, and have always been intrigued by technology and how things work, which first led me to try coding. I quickly realised that software development was the career path (and creative outlet) I had been searching for. 🔍

I truly love to learn, and I plan to build on the skills and knowledge I acquired at Makers (and independently), at a company where I can continue to grow and develop in a supportive team of passionate, driven developers, building creative solutions to important problems. 🧑‍💻🔨

## Skills

#### Problem solving 💡

I am motivated by thinking through and solving complex problems, owing to my background in academic Philosophy, which shares many transferable skills with programming. Fundamentally, both require the use of analytical skills and logic to solve problems, though with programming, there is far greater scope to apply these skills practically. In my working life, I developed a keen eye for spotting problems and coming up with solutions that save time, streamline systems and improve the function of my own role. At Ambitious about Autism, I was keen to improve upon our prospect researching system, as leads were not being followed up in a consistent manner, with low returns from new donors. I introduced a system for recording prospects in a shared spreadsheet, with reminders being set up in our CRM system for each team member to contact their allocated prospects, and then feedback the outcome of each follow-up in a streamlined, half-hour meeting. This resulted in more donations from newly established trusts, more data captured in the system, and less time wasted throughout the team.

As a developer, I have further improved my problem solving skills by implementing Makers' processes for tackling coding problems, using test-driven development methodology and step-by-step learning techniques to ensure no matter the size of a problem, following an analytical and solution driven process will simplify it and give clear direction. These new skills have enabled me to break down larger tasks, such as building a dyanmic web-game in React, or learning how to interact with API's, into reasonable, more manageable chunks. I love trying to figure out the cleanest, clearest solution when writing code, and take genuine satisfaction from grappling with and solving tricky coding problems.

#### Strong and empathetic communication 💬

In my charity role, I frequently led meetings and delivered presentations to influential donors, with a view to securing donations. These conversations required confidence, tact, and most importantly, listening skills, to understand what a donor wants and expects from a charity partnership. These meetings resulted in a number of five-figure donations, most notably, the renewal of a multi-year grant worth £20,000 annually. Equally, when working in graduate recruitment, I delivered presentations selling our internship scheme to audiences comprised of business owners, which played a significant part in our team exceeding the previous annual record of candidate placements. Working with autistic children required incredibly clear and considered communication, not only with the children, but also when navigating difficult discussions with parents, which further enhanced my ability to listen and communicate empathetically.

At Makers, daily pairing sessions meant that I worked with people who were ahead of me and people behind me in their coding journeys. This called for clear and honest communication, both to ask questions when stuck, and when taking on a more instructive role. I love working as part of a team, and I particularly enjoyed taking on a leadership position in group projects, running stand-ups and retros, overseeing ticket allocation and fostering an open environment where all team members felt confident to share their ideas and opinions. 

#### Time management and working to deadlines ⏰
 
My previous role centred around managing a large portfolio of trusts and foundations, all of which had specific deadlines for submitting funding applications. I had to carefully prioritize my workload to achieve the greatest return, whilst maintaining a high level of quality in my written applications. This required constant planning ahead, setting reminders and working to a timeline weeks in advance, to ensure that I would be able to deliver high-quality, bespoke submissions, without missing any application windows. I became used to working in a fast-paced, pressurised environment, as it was my responsibility to ensure that no opportunity was missed, as it would come at a cost to the charity and our beneficiaries.

In group coding projects, I was always vocal with regards to time-management, and always pushed for an achievable, realistic Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This ensured that at the end of each project, we would have a tangible, working product to display, and I am incredibly proud that we were able to reach and exceed MVP for each project I was part of, owing to the detailed planning and time-management set out from the start. Having become well-versed in Agile processes, I believe I am fully capable of quickly fitting in and adjusting to any Software Development team.
 
#### Fast learner 📖

I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual with a proven track record of being a fast learner. I possess the ability to quickly absorb new information, soak up knowledge from others, and apply it effectively to my work. I am confident in my ability to learn new skills and technologies, which has allowed me to swiftly adapt to new environments, both profesionally and academically. This includes observing and learning the routines and subtle behavioural differences in each of the autistic children I worked with, comprehending and writing about increasingly complex philosophical concepts during my Masters degree, or learning how to write data-rich queries and navigate the vast CRM database in my first week at the charity.

The intensive, self-directed nature of studying at Makers ensures that all students graduate as independent learners with the confidence and skills to embrace new technologies. This has given me the confidence to not only take on any technical challenge, but to embrace learning new technologies. For example, I was able to rapidly pick up complex frameworks such as React within a matter of weeks, and to learn Javascript in just two weeks. I am passionate about learning, and I look forward to continuing to pick up new languages and innovative frameworks to solve new problems within the world of programming.
